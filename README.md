# MACHINE LEARNING

Definition : Learn from Data & Solves Problem, It is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

TYPES
1 Supervised Learning : Supervised learning is a machine learning algorithm of inferring a function from labeled training data. The training data consists of a set of training examples.

2 Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning is also a type of machine learning algorithm used to find patterns on the set of data given. In this, we donâ€™t have any dependent variable or label to predict.

3 Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error.


1. Supervised Learning

I) Classification
K-Nearest Neighbor
Support Vector Machine
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Naive Bayes
Neural Network
Stochastic Gradient Descent



II) Regression

Linear Regression: If a single independent variable is used to predict the value of a numerical dependent variable, then such a Linear Regression algorithm is called Simple Linear Regression.
Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable.

Polynomial Regression: Polynomial regression, like linear regression, uses the relationship between the variables x and y to find the best way to draw a line through the data points.




2. Unsupervised Learning
Clustering: Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which models are not supervised using training dataset. Instead, models itself find the hidden patterns and insights from the given data. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the human brain while learning new things.

3 Reinforcement Learning


A confusion matrix is a table that is often used
to describe the performance of a classification
model on a set of test data for which the true
values are known
